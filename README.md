## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer originally from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and currently based in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

My interest in computers and technology began at a young age. During high school, I started learning C++ through YouTube tutorials. I realized I wanted to learn more, so I decided to enroll in a Computer Science course. I liked it so much that I decided to go for a bachelor's in Computer Science.

Most of my experience is in building web applications, both front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery) and back-end (Java, C#). Additionally, I enjoy developing console and desktop applications.

Outside of work, I play games and listen to music, which help me unwind. I also love traveling and exploring the beauty nature has to offer.
