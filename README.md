## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer originally from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and currently based in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

My interest in computers and technology began at a young age. During high school, I started learning C++ through YouTube tutorials. I realized I wanted to learn more, so I decided to enroll in an associate's course in Computer Science. I liked it so much that I decided to go for a bachelor's in Computer Science, after finishing the associate's course.

Most of my experience is in building web applications, both front-end and back-end. Additionally, I enjoy developing console and desktop applications.
